==== f:all

===== Purpose

Renders fields for all properties of an object by using `f:field` for each property.

The `id`, `version`, `dateCreated` and `lastUpdated` properties are skipped on domain classes. Additionally any property with a `display: false` constraint set will be skipped.


===== Attributes

.Attributes for f:all
[options="header",cols="1,1,3"]

|===
|Name | Required | Description

|*bean*
|if not inside `f:with`
|The bean whose property is being rendered. This can be the object itself or the name of a page-scope variable.

|*except*
| N/A
|A comma-separated list of properties that should be skipped (in addition to the defaults).

|*order*
| N/A
|A comma-separated list of properties which represents the order in which the tag should generate fields.

|===



===== Extra attributes (Since version 2.1.4)


You can pass extra attributes to the *all* tag that will be propagated to the inner fields.


===== Example


[source,groovy]
----
<f:all bean="person" wrapper="someWrapper"/>
----

In that way all the fields are going to be executed as if they were executed with the extra attribute on them.

NOTE: Remember that if you want to use some of those attributes in the *widget* templates you need to prefix them with the *widget-* word (unless you have configured another prefix)
