== Including Templates in Plugins

Plugins can include field and/or input level templates to support special UI rendering or non-standard property types. Just include the templates in the plugin's `grails-app/views` directory as described in the <<customizingFieldRendering,Customizing Field Rendering>> section.

WARNING: If you supply templates in a plugin you should consider declaring a `<%@page defaultCodec="html" %>` directive so that any HTML unsafe property values are escaped properly regardless of the default codec used by client apps.
